# Source: Constructed using U.S. EIA 2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata.
# Source: (Heat pump water heaters) 2016-17 RBSA II for CR06 and Butzbaugh et al. 2017 US HPWH Market Transformation - Where Weve Been and Where to Go Next for remainder of regions
# Assumption: Due to low samples, oil water heater efficiency distribution are lumped except for CR03 and CR07.
# Assumption: Water heater blanket is used as a proxy for premium storage tank water heaters.
# Assumption: Heat Pump Water Heaters are added in manually as they are not in the survey.
# Downselected: This characteristic was downselected from project_national.
