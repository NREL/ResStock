# Assumption: Mobile Homes have an unfinished attic because mobile homes are modeled as single-family detached homes.
# Assumption: Single-Family Attached and Single-Family Attached homes with no attic are modeled with an attic. The measures are not able to model homes without an attic.
# Assumption: Impossible dependency combinations are set to None.
# Downselected: This characteristic was downselected from project_national.
