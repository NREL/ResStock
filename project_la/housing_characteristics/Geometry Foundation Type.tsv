# Created by: sources\recs\2009\tsv_maker.py (manually modified by Joe Robertson)
# Source: The sample counts and sample weights are constructed using U.S. EIA 2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata.
# Assumption: All mobile homes have Ambient foundations.
# Assumption: Multi-family buildings cannot have Ambient and Heated Basements
# Assumption: Single-family attached buildings cannot have Ambient foundations
# Assumption: Foundation types are the same for each building type except mobile homes and the applicable options.
# Assumption: Because we need to assume a foundation type for ground-floor MF units, we use the lumped SFD+SFA distributions for MF2-4 and MF5+ building foundations. (RECS data for households in MF2-4 unit buildings are not useful since we do not know which floor the unitis on. RECS does not include foundation responses for households in MF5+ unit buildings.)
# Assumption: For SFD and SFA, if no foundation type specified, then sample has Ambient foundation.
# Downselected: This characteristic was downselected from project_national.
