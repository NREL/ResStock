# Source: Constructed using U.S. EIA 2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata.
# Created by: https://github.com/NREL/resstock-estimation/blob/tsp_updates/sources/recs/2009/Setback%20Distributions.ipynb
# Assumptions: RECS data is queried from two building type groups: 1) Single-Family Detached and Mobile Homes and 2) Single-Family Attached, Multi-family with 2-4 Units, and Multi-Family with 5+ Units
# Assumptions: Dependencies with sample sizes < 10 used the combined data for both multifamily and single-family homes
# Downselected: This characteristic was downselected from project_national.
