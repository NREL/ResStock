# Assumption: Qualitative lamp type fractions in each household surveyed are distributed to three options representing 100% incandescent, 100% CFl, and 100% LED lamp type options.
# Assumption: Due to low sample sizes for some Building Types, Building Type data are grouped into: 1) Single-Family Detached and Mobile Homes, and 2) Multifamily 2-4 units and Multifamily 5+ units, and 3) Single-Family Attached.
# Assumption: Single-Family Attached units in the West South Central census division has the same LED saturation as Multi-Family
# Assumption: LED saturation is adjusted to match the U.S. projected saturation in the 2019 Energy Savings Forecast of Solid-State Lighting in General Illumination Applications.
# Downselected: This characteristic was downselected from project_national.
