"# average weekday and weekend schedules are derived from a national-scale ResStock run, where charging and discharging schedules are built using the occupancy schedule and total hours driven in a year",,,,,,,,,,,
"# default discharging schedules are calculated by proportionally applying the total daily hours to the max 3 discharge hours, resulting in 3 discrete discharge events that sum to the daily average hours",,,,,,,,,,,
# default charging schedules assume the EV is plugged in before for all hours before the first driving event and after the last driving event,,,,,,,,,,,
