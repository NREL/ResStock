"""
Electrical Panel Project: Estimate panel capacity using NEC 220.87 (2023)
- Focuses on leeway/slack (decrease in amperage) created by upgrade packages in EUSS data
- Compares this leeway to increases in amperage when new loads are added for electrification

By: Julia.Ehlers@nrel.gov
Date: 07/06/2023

--------------------

NEC 220.87 - Determining Existing Loads
  - Uses maximum demand data from a year to size service/electrical panel
  - Takes maximum demand (plus new load if applicable) times power factor 1.25 to find kVA of current load
  - Divide kVA value by 240 V to find panel amperage

kW = kVA * PF
  - kW: working/active power
  - kVA: apparent (active + reactive) power; used to size panel
  - PF: power factor; usually 0.8 for inductive load
  
Note: 1.25 comes from dividing both sides of above equation by 0.8.
To find panel size, take active power (from dataset) and multiply by 1.25 (or divide by its reciprocal, 0.8).

--------------------

OTHER NOTES:
- Baseline package data from input file starts with 'pkg_00.'
- All upgrade package data from input starts with 'pkg_##.' where ## is the package number (single digit, add a zero)
- Use 'combine_raw_files_for_nec_220_87.py' program to create an input file for this program
