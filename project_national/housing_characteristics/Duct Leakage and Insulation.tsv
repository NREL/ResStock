# Created by: sources\other\tsv_maker.py
# Description: Duct insulation and leakage to outside from the portion of ducts in unconditioned spaces
# Source: Duct insulation as a function of location: IECC 2009
# Source: Leakage distribution: Lucas and Cole, 'Impacts of the 2009 IECC for Residential Buildings at State Level', 2009
# Assumption: Ducts entirely in conditioned spaces will not have any leakage to outside. Ducts with R-4/R-8 insulation were previously assigned to Geometry Foundation Type = Ambient or Slab. They now correspond to those with Duct Location = Garage, Unvented Attic, or Vented Attic.
