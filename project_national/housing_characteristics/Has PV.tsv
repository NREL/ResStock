# Created by: sources\dpv\tsv_maker.py
# Description: The dwelling unit has a rooftop photovoltaic system.
# Source: Constructed using ACS population and RiDER data on PV installation that combines LBNL's 2020 Tracking the Sun and Wood Mackenzie's 2020 Q4 PV report (prepared by Nicholas.Willems@nrel.gov on Jun 22, 2021)
# Assumption: Imposed an upperbound of 14 kWDC, which contains 95pct of all installations. Counties with source_count<10 are backfilled with aggregates at the State level. Distribution based on all installations is applied only to occupied SFD, actual distribution for SFD may be higher.
# Assumption: PV is not modeled in AK and HI. No data has been identified.
