        # Source: Custom regression by Brennan Less. Ductless heat pump project costs were regressed on nameplate tons,
        # from data described in in Less et al. https://doi.org/10.20357/B7FP4D. January 2019 $ inflated to April 2023 $ using 1.21 factor.
        # Ductless MSHP n=173, HSPF median 11, range 9.3–14.2. Implicitly includes multiple zones and electrical upgrades.
        # Regression results in costs that are 15–30% higher than costs from The Heat Pump Store as documented in https://redwoodenergy.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Pocket-Guide-to-All-Electric-Retrofits-of-Single-Family-Homes.pdf 
        # LBNL data were not sufficient to include a relationship between SEER or HSPF and cost, so cost deltas for higher 
        # and lower HSPF were added using the relationship between HSPF and cost for ductless MSHPs in REMDB: 2.2% addition or subtraction per point
        # according to how many points above or below the HSPF rating is from 10.5 (https://remdb.nrel.gov/).
