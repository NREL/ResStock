\chapter{Housing Characteristics and Inputs} \label{sec:resstock_inputs}

In this section, we overview each of the input housing characteristics for ResStock in detail including ResStock options, associated ResStock arguments, and the details of each of those arguments. In ResStock, each input characteristic gets its own input file. The full set of housing characteristic input files is available in the main \href{https://github.com/NREL/resstock/tree/v3.3.0/project_national}{ResStock GitHub repository}.  We discuss each of these input files as well as the general theory for how different systems and components are modeled. Within each section we also provide the national-level stock saturation of each option within a characteristic. These top-level saturations collapse much of the detail and nuance in ResStock's probability distributions, but the saturations serve to give a sense of how common different options are, generally, in the United States.

We organize this discussion by the major types of inputs: Geography, Geometry, Envelope, HVAC, Water Heating, Appliances, Lighting, Plug Loads, and Household characteristics. For each of these major sections, we discuss ResStock's approach to these input types, highlighting where it might vary from OS-HPXML. In the argument tables, a selection of ``auto'' means that the value is being calculated or defaulted in OS-HPXML. Additionally, we discuss weather inputs to ResStock, which is specified separately from the main input files. 

\section{Geography}
ResStock provides a wide range of geographic inputs and outputs. These fields allow for detailed input probability distributions for the U.S.~residential building stock characterization. These geography fields are also useful for aggregating and analyzing ResStock outputs.

All the geography fields are compiled into a geography lookup table that contains census block-level resolution. For reference, the Geography Hierarchy Diagram for Census geographies can be found on the \href{https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/geodiagram.pdf}{Geography Hierarchy Diagram} U.S.~Census website. This diagram shows that the fundamental geography is a census block. All other census geographies stem from this definition. This hierarchy is used to create a lookup table for all geography characteristics in ResStock. 

Added to this table are occupied and vacant unit counts for each census block from the \href{https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo.html}{2020 U.S.~Census Redistricting Data} and ACS 5-year 2016 data. The ACS number of units is specified by census tract and downscaled to the census block level using the 2020 Redistricting data. The 2020 census block data are converted to 2010 census blocks using the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) \href{https://www.nhgis.org/geographic-crosswalks}{Geographic Crosswalks}. All the characteristics and distributions of housing characteristics are pivoted from this lookup table relating the geography definitions and housing unit counts. Also in this lookup file is the NHGIS GISJOIN codes that help join this file to other geography fields not in the lookup table or the ResStock outputs.

The ACS housing unit data are typically used by ResStock to specify in the project file the number of housing units in the United States. The ACS data are a 5-year average compared to the single-year 2020 Redistricting data. Consistency for using ACS for unit counts at the census geographies is also achieved except for the ``City'' characteristic. The City characteristic uses the downscaled data from the ACS to census block, because City boundaries are specified by census blocks. 

The census geographies are set to be consistent with the U.S.~Census Bureau's definitions as of July 1, 2015. The 2010 Census geography definitions and changes between the 2010 Census and July 1, 2015, can be found on the \href{https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade.html}{U.S.~Census Bureau Decennial Census} website.

When looking at the structure of the Geography dependencies, the ASHRAE IECC 2004 input file does not have any dependencies. ASHRAE IECC 2004 is the top-level geography characteristic. The reason this climate zone characteristic is first and not some U.S.~Census characteristic is because of the way the ResStock Sampling algorithm works. By using the large climate zones, more uniformity is achieved in the spatial allocation of the samples. From ASHRAE IECC climate zone, the County and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) characteristic is assigned, placing the sample in the smallest resolution geographic characteristic. From here the other geographic characteristics are various aggregations of the County and PUMA field or larger geographies.

In discussing the Geography inputs to ResStock, we break it down into four subcategories: Census Geographies, Climate Zones, Grid and Emissions Geographies, and Other Geographies.

\subsubsection{State}
\paragraph{Description}
The U.S.~state where the sample is located. In ResStock, States are defined by a collection of Counties.

\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize} 
\item
  Spatial definitions are from the U.S.~Census Bureau as of July 1,
  2015.
\item
  Unit counts are from the American Community Survey 5-year 2016.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
\begin{itemize} 
\item County.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Options}
The options for each State are the collection of postal abbreviations (e.g., AL, AK, AR). Each option sets the \texttt{site\_state\_code} argument. The \texttt{site\_state\_code} argument choices are also the State abbreviations. An example option and argument assignment for Alabama is as follows: the option name is AL and \texttt{site\_state\_code}=AL. The rest of the States follow this structure.

SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, VT, WA, WI, WV, WY & State code of the home
address. \\
\end{longtable}

\paragraph{Distribution Assumption(s)}
No assumptions are made.


\subsubsection{County}
\paragraph{Description}
The U.S.~County where the sample is located.

\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize} 
\item
  Spatial definitions are from the U.S.~Census Bureau as of July 1,
  2015.
\item
  Unit counts are from the American Community Survey 5-year 2016.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item County and PUMA.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Options}
The County characteristic options are structured using the State name and County name. An example of the option corresponding to Denver County in Colorado would be ``CO, Denver County''. The ResStock arguments \texttt{simulation\_control\_daylight\_saving\_enabled}, \texttt{site\_zip\_code}, \texttt{site\_time\_zone\_utc\_offset}, and \texttt{weather\_station\_epw\_filepath} are not constant across all the County options. 

The \texttt{simulation\_control\_daylight\_saving\_enabled} argument is set to ``true'' except in Arizona where all the counties are set to ``false.'' 

The \texttt{site\_zip\_code} argument is assigned by using a single zip code for the entire county.

The \texttt{site\_time\_zone\_utc\_offset} argument is assigned using the population centroid of each county. As time zones cut through counties, some units will have the wrong time zone. Since the population centroid is used, the bounding error for units being in the wrong counties is 50\%.

The \texttt{weather\_station\_epw\_filepath} argument is ``../../../weather/<County GISJOIN>.epw'' where <County GISJOIN> is the NHGIS GISJOIN value for the county. The NHGISJOIN for a county always starts with the letter ``G'' followed by the state's two-digit FIPS, a ``0,'' and then the County 3-digit FIPS code. An example of this argument assignment for the option ``CO, Denver County'' is \texttt{weather\_station\_epw\_filepath}=../../../weather/G0800310.epw.

the EnergyPlus Weather (EPW) file. \\
\end{longtable}

\paragraph{Distribution Assumption(s)}
No assumptions are made.

\subsubsection{Public Use Microdata Area}
\paragraph{Description}
The Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) from 2010 U.S.~Census that the sample is located. PUMAs are a collection of census tracts that do not cross state boundaries. They contain no fewer than 100,000 people and typically represent no more than 200,000 people. PUMAs are smaller in land area when located near large cities compared to rural areas. PUMAs typically do not follow County boundaries. A map of the 2010 PUMAs can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:2010_puma_boundaries}.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize} 
\item
  Spatial definitions are from the U.S.~Census Bureau as of July 1,
  2015.
\item
  Unit counts are from the American Community Survey 5-year 2016.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item County and PUMA.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Options}
The options for PUMAs are structured by their state abbreviation and the PUMA code from the GISJOIN code. The GISJOIN values are found in the 2010 TIGER/LINE Basis file on the \href{https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/boundaries.shtml}{IPUMS GIS Boundary Files}  website. An example is G01002100, which represents state FIPS code AL, and 02100 is the AL, Elmore, Autauga, Montgomery -Outer- and Lowndes Counties PUMA.

There are three ResStock arguments set with the PUMA options: \texttt{site\_elevation}, \texttt{site\_latitude}, and \texttt{site\_longitude}. All three of these arguments are set to ``auto'' and use the default \href{https://openstudio-hpxml.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.1/workflow_inputs.html#hpxml-building-site}{OpenStudio-HPXML Building Site} values.

\end{longtable}

\paragraph{Distribution Assumption(s)}
No assumptions are made.

\subsubsection{County and PUMA}
\paragraph{Description}
The GISJOIN identifier for the County and the PUMA where the sample is located. Since Counties and PUMAs are both a collection of census tracts, often a PUMA is in multiple counties. This characteristic describes the combination of County and PUMA where the sample is located.

\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize}
 
\item
  Spatial definitions are from the U.S.~Census Bureau as of July 1,
  2015.

\paragraph{Options}
The options for County and PUMA are a combination of the NHGIS GISJOIN Code for the County and the PUMA separated by a comma. An example option is ``G0100010, G01002100''---G0100010 is the County GISJOIN for Autauga County, AL, and G01002100 is the PUMA GISJOIN for the AL, Elmore, Autauga, Montgomery -Outer- and Lowndes Counties PUMA.

\paragraph{Distribution Assumption(s)}
No assumptions are made.

\subsubsection{Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area}
\paragraph{Description}
The U.S.~Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or Micropolitan Statistical Area (MicroSA) where sample is located. The U.S.~Census defines a set of counties as Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). These CBSAs are either assigned a MicroSA or combined into a larger MSA. According to the U.S.~Census, each metropolitan statistical area must have at least one urban area of 50,000 or more inhabitants. According to the U.S.~Census, each MicroSA must have at least one urban area of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 population.

\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item County and PUMA.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Options}
The options are structured as the State abbreviation of the city, a comma, and the name of the city. An example is ``AR, Jonesboro,'' which corresponds to Jonesboro, Arkansas.

The ResStock argument \texttt{site\_city} is assigned in the City characteristic. The argument is set to ``auto,'' which is the OpenStudio-HPXML default value; see the OpenStudio-HPXML \href{https://openstudio-hpxml.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.1/workflow_inputs.html#hpxml-building-site}{Building Site} section of the documentation for the default values.

    \item The PUMA Metro Status, derived from ACS IPUMS METRO codes, indicates whether the household resided within a metropolitan area and, for households in metropolitan areas, whether the household resided within or outside of a central/principal city. Each PUMA has a unique METRO status in ACS and therefore has a unique PUMA Metro Status. IPUMS derives METRO codes for samples not directly identified based on available geographic information and whether the associated county group or PUMA lies wholly or only partially within metropolitan areas or principal cities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Climate Zones}
This section of ResStock characteristics is a set of climate zone definitions. There are five input files to ResStock that specify climate zones:

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
There are no direct conditional dependencies.

\paragraph{Options}
A set of counties defines each climate and moisture zone. Climate zones range from 1--8 and moisture zones are indicated by A, B, and C. 

The ASHRAE IECC Climate Zone 2004 sets the \texttt{site\_type} and \texttt{site\_iecc\_zone} arguments. The \texttt{site\_type} is always set to ``auto.'' The \texttt{site\_iecc\_zone} argument matches the climate zone with the exception of climate zones 7 and 8 in Alaska. ResStock departs from the climate zone definitions by using 7AK and 8AK instead of 7 and 8 from the standards.

\subsection{Weather Data}
Weather data are closely related to the specification of geography inputs, since weather varies by location. In ResStock, weather data are not specified in the Housing Characteristics input data like most things, but are specified as their own set of input files. In ResStock, weather files are specified at the county level, although sometimes adjacent counties share the same weather files.

As is standard in most building energy models, ResStock can be run with either Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) or Actual Meteorological Year (AMY) data. Hypothetically, ResStock could be run with any other weather data in EPW format, but all data releases to date have been based upon TMY or AMY data. TMY are synthetically constructed files based upon historic weather where each month of the year is picked from the most representative (i.e., ``typical'') real month from the previous 30 years (\cite{Wilcox2008}). This has the advantage of avoiding extreme or unusual weather, and can be appropriate for analyses that aggregate annual energy use. However, TMY files, by design, will not capture worst-case or extreme situations. Also, given that TMYs are constructed upon historical weather, it is unlikely they truly represent what is ``typical'' for a location given the reality of accelerating climate change. ``Typical'' is a moving target, and what was typical 10 years ago is less likely to be typical today. Furthermore, TMY has the disadvantage that adjacent weather stations might not use the same historical years for the same months. For example, a TMY in Denver, CO, might use 2012 for the July file, but 30 miles (40 kilometers) away, the Boulder, CO, TMY station might use 1999 for July. This misalignment of weather years can lead to modeling of non-coincident temporal energy use in ResStock and will likely lead to the underrepresentation of electricity peaks when considering geographies spread across more than one weather file.

AMY weather files overcome the location misalignment issue by using real weather data from a recent historical year. Having a recent file also helps with some of the historical bias from constructing files from data up to 30 years old, but it does not capture future climate change-driven weather patterns. A potential problem with AMY is that it inherits any abnormalities that occurred in a given year. For example, if a particular year was unusually cold, cooling demands would be lower than you might generally see and heating loads a bit higher.  In ResStock, we generally run our models with both 2018 AMY and TMY weather~\citep{Bianchi2021}. 2018 is a year for which we have sufficient metered data for comparison, and it is also a compatible year for many grid simulation tools. 

\subsubsection{Weather File Development}

Since ResStock is a composite model of many EnergyPlus models, it employs the standard EnergyPlus Weather (EPW) files (\cite{BigLadderSoftware2015}). The EPW weather format provides a timeseries dataset of a wide array of weather variables across all 8,760 hours of a non-leap year. These weather variables provide the climatic inputs for simulating heat transfer at each time step for each model within ResStock. For the TMY files, we use the most recent release, TMY3 from \citet{Wilcox2008}.\footnote{In review of the TMY3 data, we have identified some outliers in the initially published TMY3 data (e.g., erroneous temperature spikes). We have corrected those for ResStock use and published our corrected versions \citep{Bianchi2021}. }  For AMY,  we construct our own EPW files for internal use that are not available to the public. Some of the weather variables needed to construct an EPW are available on the \href{https://data.openei.org/submissions/4520}{Load Profiles OEDI submission}. 

We develop custom AMY weather data files by pulling historic hourly temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, and atmospheric pressure from the \href{https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database}{Integrated Surface Database}, developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center. Additionally, we add in satellite-derived solar radiation data from NREL’s National Solar Radiation Database~\citep{nsrdb}. Ground-based solar radiation data are not widely collected, so using satellite-derived solar radiation data is standard practice for both the solar industry and building energy modelers using historical weather data. Caveats and further information on the data compilation and gap filling of this custom AMY approach can be found in Section 2.4 of \citet{Wilson2022}. 

\subsubsection{Mapping Weather Files to ResStock Samples}
To produce weather files for ResStock, we develop AMY EPWs for approximately 1,200 weather stations pulling data from the year 2018---with the 2018 AMY roughly mapping to the locations of the TMY3 data.\footnote{Occasionally nearby stations are used if data are missing from the target weather station.} In ResStock, each county is assigned one of these available 1,200  weather stations. Each county will receive a weather station that is located in the county if one is available; if not, the county will be assigned a weather station closest to the county's population centroid, with prioritization of stations in the same climate zone. Timestamps are shifted if the chosen weather file is in a different time zone. All housing units within a given county will use the assigned weather data for that county for simulations. Within the model, actual weather file assignment occurs in the options\_lookup.tsv as a parameter input into the ResStockArguments script. 

\subsubsection{Weather Files and Equipment Sizing}
In addition to the 8,760 timeseries of weather variables in the timeseries energy simulation, EPW files also provide a header with basic information on the weather location. ResStock uses some of this header information for sizing HVAC equipment---see Table \ref{Tab:Packages}.

\section{Geometry}

In this section, we discuss the inputs that control the actual geometry of the building energy model used for simulation of each sample. We discuss the geometry parameters in five categories: housing unit location, building type, construction year, housing unit geometry, and space geometry. 

\subsection{Housing Unit Location}

There are two reference frames for locating the housing units modeled in ResStock: (1) the building frame of reference and (2) the polar reference frame. The building frame defines the front, back, top, bottom, left, and right sides of the unit. The polar reference frame defines the orientation of the unit's front door with respect to the cardinal directions north, south, east, and west. 

In ResStock, housing units are modeled as single zones, regardless if they are in larger buildings. To do this, adiabatic walls are assigned/modeled for walls, ceilings, or floors shared between the modeled housing unit and an adjacent unit.
%For identifying adiabatic walls, the process starts with distributions for the number of units in the building where the unit model is located. There are different distributions for the number of units in the building for single-family attached and multi-family units. The number of units characteristics are Geometry Building Number of Units MF and Geometry Building Number of Units SFA. Next, the number of stories is sampled in the Geometry Stories characteristic. Once a number of units for the building and the number of stories are sampled for the model, the horizontal and vertical locations of the unit are sampled in the Geometry Building Horizontal Location MF, Geometry Building Horizontal Location SFA, and Geometry Building Level MF characteristics. 

%Single-family attached units have the possibility of their right and left sides being adiabatic. If the single-family attached unit is an end unit, one of the walls are adiabatic (the right or the left side). If the single-family attached unit is a middle unit both the left and right walls of the unit are adiabatic. Multi-family units follow the same rules as single-family attached, but add if the unit is a top, bottom, or middle unit. If the multi-family unit is a middle unit the top, bottom, left, and right walls are adiabatic. If the multi-family unit is a top unit, the bottom wall (floor) is adiabatic. If the multi-family unit is a bottom unit the top wall (ceiling) is adiabatic. For top and bottom multi-family units, left and right adiabatic walls are determined using the horizontal position {\footnote{see discussion of single-family attached units previously in this paragraph}. Single-family attached units the front and back are heat transfer surfaces. Multi-family units in ResStock have a front heat transfer surface, while the back is adiabatic (connected to an interior double corridor)}.

The units are shaded by how near other buildings are to the modeled unit.  OpenStudio-HPXML can model shading with exterior corridors for multifamily units, but ResStock does not use these capabilities for multifamily or single-family attached units.

There are 12 input files controlling building siting in ResStock:

\paragraph{Options}
The options for Neighbors are Left/Right at 15 ft, 2, 4,	7, 12, 27, and None. The option values correspond to distances in feet to the nearest neighbor on the left and right sides of the building. The options set ResStock arguments corresponding to the distance and height a shading object. The \texttt{neighbor\_front\_height}, \texttt{neighbor\_back\_height}, \texttt{neighbor\_left\_height} and \texttt{neighbor\_right\_height} arguments are all set to ``auto,'' which sets the shading object height to the total height of the housing unit. The other arguments assign the distance from the housing unit. The \texttt{neighbor\_front\_distance} and \texttt{neighbor\_back\_distance} arguments are set to 0 (meaning there are no neighbors to the front and back of the unit). The left and right distances are set by Table \ref{table:hc_opt_neighbor}. The None option sets distances to 0 (meaning there are no neighbors). The argument definitions can be seen in Table \ref{table:hc_arg_def_neighbors}.

\subsubsection{Corridor}
\paragraph{Description}
Type of corridor attached to multifamily units.

\paragraph{Modeling Approach}
Single-family attached and multifamily buildings can have corridors, which are passageways between units. Interior corridors are enclosed and assumed to be conditioned, which are modeled by adiabatic walls being created for the wall of the unit that is adjacent to the corridor. Exterior corridors provide shading, but are not enclosed. The way this is modeled is to add a shading object to the front and/or the back of the unit. ResStock only allows multifamily units to have a double-loaded interior corridor. ResStock does not model energy use (e.g., lighting, plug load, or HVAC) associated with corridors; it only models their impact on the multifamily housing units.
 
\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Engineering judgment.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometry Building Type RECS.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Options}
For Mobile Homes, Single-Family Detached, and Single-Family Attached building types the option assigned is ``Not Applicable.'' Multifamily units all have a ``Double-Loaded Interior'' corridor with a width of 10 feet. The Corridor characteristic assigns the \texttt{geometry\_corridor\_position} and the \texttt{geometry\_corridor\_width} arguments. For the options and arguments set for each option, see Table \ref{table:hc_opt_corridor}. For the argument definitions, see Table \ref{table:hc_arg_def_corridor}.

\subsection{Building Type}
This section discusses the ResStock input files that control tagging and model differentiation of building type.  These building types control a lot of assumptions and treatment of variables in the OpenStudio-HPXML workflow. An example is that the plug load energy is based on a regression equation, and the equation coefficients are different between the building types.

There are two input files controlling building type assignment in ResStock:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometry Building Type ACS
    \item Geometry Building Type RECS.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Geometry Building Type ACS}
\paragraph{Description}
The building type classification according to the U.S.~Census American Community Survey.

\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2019 5-year PUMS from the University of Minnesota.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item PUMA.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Options}
ACS considers nine building types, which are tagged in ResStock based on PUMA. No arguments are directly assigned based on this input characteristic.

\paragraph{Options}
The EIA RECS building types are direct aggregations of the ACS building types. Multifamily units are grouped into 2--4 unit buildings and 5+ unit buildings. The options set the \texttt{geometry\_unit\_type}, \texttt{geometry\_unit\_aspect\_ratio}, and \texttt{geometry\_average\_ceiling\_height} ResStock arguments; see Table \ref{table:hc_opt_gbt_recs}. The \texttt{geometry\_average\_ceiling\_height} is always set to 8 ft. The argument definitions are in Table \ref{table:hc_arg_def_gbt_recs}.

\subsection{Construction Year}
ResStock captures the change in energy codes over time by relying on survey data (mainly from ACS and EIA RECS) to inform how housing units have adopted energy code vintages and retrofits over time. The approach used in ResStock is to assign a decadal bin when the building was constructed. The decadal bins range from pre-1940s to the 2010s. The Vintage and Vintage ACS characteristics are then used as dependencies to assign probabilities for each Vintage bin. For example, wall insulation being dependent on vintage allows the wall insulation R-value mean to increase over time.

There are two input files controlling building type assignment in ResStock:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Vintage
    \item Vintage ACS.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Vintage}
\paragraph{Description}
Time period in which the building was originally constructed.

\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2019 5-year PUMS from the University of Minnesota.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometry Building Type ACS
    \item PUMA.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Options}
The options are decade bins for when the building was constructed: <1940, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s. The options set the \texttt{year\_built} and \texttt{vintage} ResStock arguments. The \texttt{year\_built} argument is always set to ``auto.'' The \texttt{vintage} argument is set to the same value as the option name; see Table \ref{table:hc_opt_vintage}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Housing Unit Geometry}

There are seven input files controlling housing unit geometry in ResStock:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometry Building Floor Area
    \item Geometry Building Floor Area Bin
    \item Bedrooms
    \item Geometry Attic Type
    \item Geometry Foundation Type
    \item Geometry Garage
    \item Geometry Space Combination.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Geometry Floor Area}
\paragraph{Description}
The conditioned floor area of the housing unit using bins from 2017--2019 American Housing Survey.

\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2017 and 2019 American Housing Survey microdata.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Census Division
    \item Geometry Building Type RECS
    \item Income RECS2020
    \item PUMA Metro Status
    \item Tenure.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Options}
The options of Geometry Floor Area characteristic are the American Housing Survey floor area bins. The options set the \texttt{geometry\_unit\_cfa}, \texttt{geometry\_unit\_cfa\_bin}, and the \texttt{geometry\_garage\_protrusion} ResStock arguments; see Table \ref{table:hc_opt_geom_floor_area}. The \texttt{geometry\_unit\_cfa} argument is always set to ``auto.'' Because in the ResStockArguments measure ``auto'' is used for the \texttt{geometry\_unit\_cfa} argument, a representative conditioned floor area is assigned using the \texttt{geometry\_unit\_cfa\_bin} argument. The values of the conditioned floor area bin are taken from the 2017 and 2019 American Housing Surveys and split out by housing type. The housing types are single-family detached, single-family attached, apartment, and manufactured homes. Currently, the same conditioned floor area values are used for single-family detached and manufactured homes. For the ResStock argument definition see Table \ref{table:hc_arg_def_geom_floor_area}. See the OpenStudio-HPXML \href{https://openstudio-hpxml.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.1/workflow_inputs.html#hpxml-building-construction}{Building Construction} section of the documentation. The floor area is used many places in the OpenStudio-HPXML model workflow.

    \item Only Single-Family Detached homes are assigned a probability for attached garage.
    \item No garage for ambient (i.e., pier \& beam) foundation type.
    \item Due to modeling constraints restricting that garage cannot be larger or deeper than livable space: Single-family detached units that are 0--1499 square feet can only have a maximum of a 1-car garage.
    \item Single-family detached units that are 0--1499 square feet and 3+ stories cannot have a garage.
    \item The geometry stories distributions are all the same except for 0--1499 square feet and 3 stories.
    \item Single-family detached units that are 1500--2499 square feet cannot have a 3-car garage.
    \item Single-family detached units that are 2500--3999 square feet and a heated basement cannot have a 3-car garage. 
    \item Due to low sample sizes, the following sets of dependencies are progressively lumped together. 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [1] Crawl, basements, and slab are lumped.
    \item [2] Story levels are lumped together.
    \item [3] Census Division RECS is grouped into Census Region.
    \item [4] Vintage ACS is grouped into: pre-1960, 1960-1999, and 2000+.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Geometry Space Combination}
\paragraph{Description}
Valid combinations of building type, building level mf, attic, foundation, and garage.

\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item U.S.~EIA 2020 RECS microdata.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometry Attic Type
    \item Geometry Building Level MF
    \item Geometry Building Type RECS
    \item Geometry Foundation Type
    \item Geometry Garage.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Options}
The options are a direct mapping of Geometry Building Type, Geometry Building Level MF, Geometry Foundation Type, Geometry Attic Type, and Geometry Garage. 

\paragraph{Distribution Assumption(s)}
No assumptions are made. The options of the dependencies are directly mapped into options of this characteristic.



\section{Envelope}

The envelope components of ResStock inputs interface closely with the Geometry inputs, but focus more on the materials and thermal properties of the envelope. In this section, we discuss the various input files that control the modeled envelope in ResStock by envelope component. 


\subsection{Walls}

There are three major input files to ResStock that control the wall properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometry Wall Type
    \item Geometry Wall Exterior Finish
    \item Insulation Wall.
\end{itemize}

Collectively, they specify the material choices and R-value of the housing unit walls. 

\subsubsection{Geometry Wall Type}\label{geometry_wall_type}
\paragraph{Description}
The wall material used for thermal mass calculations of exterior walls.

\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize}
 
\item
  HIFLD Parcel data.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometry Building Type RECS
    \item Geometry Story Bin
    \item State
    \item Vintage ACS.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Option(s)}
ResStock models four different wall types: Brick, Concrete, Steel Frame, and Wood Frame. This is the interior structure of the wall, not the exterior cladding. This input file does not have any ResStock arguments, but other input files that influence the thermal properties of the model are dependent on Geometry Wall Type.

\paragraph{Distribution Assumption(s)}
\begin{itemize}
 
\item
  Rows where sample size \textless{} 10 are replaced with aggregated
  values down-scaled from dep=\textquotesingle State\textquotesingle{}
  to dep=\textquotesingle Census Division RECS\textquotesingle{}.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Geometry Wall Exterior Finish}\label{geometry_wall_exterior_finish}
\paragraph{Description}
Wall siding material and color. This is the main input file that provides the thermal property arguments for the exterior cladding of a wall.
\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize}
 
\item
  HIFLD Parcel data.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometry Wall Type
    \item State
    \item Vintage ACS.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Option(s)}
ResStock uses 11 options (see Table \ref{table:hc_opt_geo_wall_ext_fin}) for the exterior finish of the walls---correlated with the Geometry Wall Type via the input dependencies. A portion of the wall R-value is attributable to this exterior finish.

\subsection{Roof and Ceiling}

There are three input files describing thermal properties of the roof and/or ceilings of housing units:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Insulation Roof
    \item Insulation Ceiling
    \item Roof Material.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, there is an input for defining Radiant Barriers in homes with attics, but it is not currently used in ResStock.

A major assumption in ResStock is that multifamily buildings and mobile homes do not have attics (see Section \ref{space_geometry}), so their insulation is assigned in Insulation Ceiling, while for other building types it is assigned in the Insulation Roof housing characteristic.


\subsubsection{Insulation Roof}\label{insulation_roof}
\paragraph{Description}
Finished roof insulation level. Insulation levels for unfinished attics covered separately. 

\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item

\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometry Attic Type.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Option(s)}
Insulation roof options correspond to the amount of insulation at the roof deck and if the roof is finished; see Table \ref{table:hc_ins_roof}. A finished roof is a cathedralized construction of the roof. An unfinished roof corresponds to the roof deck being open to the attic.

\subsubsection{Window Areas}\label{window_areas}
\paragraph{Description}
Window-to-wall ratios for the front, back, left, and right walls.
\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize}
 
\item
  2016--17 Residential Building Stock Assessment (RBSA) II microdata.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Direct Conditional Dependencies}
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometry Building Type Height.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Option(s)}
ResStock arguments use window-to-wall ratios to specify the window area instead of defining absolute window areas. Therefore, the following wall area constants are all set to zero in ResStock:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  \texttt{window\_area\_front} = 0
    \item \texttt{window\_area\_back} = 0 
    \item \texttt{window\_area\_left} = 0
    \item \texttt{window\_area\_right} = 0
    \item \texttt{skylight\_area\_front} = 0 
    \item \texttt{skylight\_area\_back} = 0
    \item \texttt{skylight\_area\_left} = 0
    \item \texttt{skylight\_area\_right} = 0.

\end{itemize}

ResStock has six different levels of window-to-wall ratios between 0.06 and 0.3 (Table \ref{table:hc_opt_window_area}). Window-to-wall ratios are assumed constant on all sides of the home.

Additionally, the \texttt{window\_aspect\_ratio} is set to 1.333 for all ResStock options.

\subsection{Infiltration}
Infiltration is air leakage between the envelope and the outdoor environment. In the U.S.~residential sector, it is the leading driver of heating and cooling loads (compared to, for example, heat transfer through other parts of the envelope). In ResStock, infiltration is controlled by a single input file that provides a whole-home infiltration rate. 
\subsubsection{Infiltration}\label{infiltration}
\paragraph{Description}
Air leakage rates for the living and garage spaces.
\paragraph{Distribution Data Source(s)}
\begin{itemize}
 
\item
  Distributions are based on the cumulative distribution functions from
  the \href{http://resdb.lbl.gov/}{Residential Diagnostics Database (ResDB)}.
\item
  Alaska-specific distribution is based on Alaska Retrofit Information
  System (2008 to 2022), maintained by Alaska Housing Finance
  Corporation.
