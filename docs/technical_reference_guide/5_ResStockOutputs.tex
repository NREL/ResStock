\chapter{ResStock Outputs}\label{sec:resstock_outputs}
ResStock produces a range of results around energy, housing characteristics, schedules, emissions, and costs. This section overviews the outputs available in the latest ResStock data release (2024 release 2). The data dictionary that summarizes these outputs is available with the \href{https://oedi-data-lake.s3.amazonaws.com/nrel-pds-building-stock/end-use-load-profiles-for-us-building-stock/2024/resstock_amy2018_release_2/data_dictionary.tsv}{data release}.  

\section{Building Characteristics}
%Tables - basically our data dictionaries (ideally automated). Data dictionaries are already automated but need heavy QC
The ResStock workflow generates a sample of residential housing units using the conditional distributions and sampling methodology described in Section \ref{sec:sampling_methodology}. Each housing unit sample is specified using a set of characteristics, which include location, housing type, vintage,  heating fuel, building size and geometry, materials, information on the HVAC system, insulation, infiltration, appliances, as well as information on occupant demographics and  behavior. These characteristics are used for the model creation process, but they are also available as metadata associated with the results. The metadata is useful for performing analysis and slicing the data into segments. Some characteristics directly impact the OpenStudio model creation (e.g., wall insulation levels), whereas others are meta-parameters used as tags (e.g., ISO/RTO region) or as characteristics that correlate with other energy-relevant characteristics (e.g., vintage). Each of these characteristics is described in detail in Section \ref{sec:resstock_inputs}, and are summarized in Table \ref{table:hc_output_fields}. In published ResStock datasets, these housing characteristics are the fields that use the ``in'' prefix followed by the housing characteristic name, for example ``in.windows'' for the Windows characteristic. If an upgrade or measure changes a housing characteristic, the post-upgrade characteristic uses the ``upgrade'' prefix, for example ``upgrade.windows.'' 

Most national ResStock data releases have approximately one sample for every 250 housing units that actually exist in the modeled geography, though this can vary if the sample size is increased or decreased. Taken together, the set of samples describes the housing stock with its intrinsic variety and is used as both an output of ResStock and an input to further steps in the ResStock workflow (see Section \ref{sec:workflow} for more information about the workflow). 

Note that ResStock assigns certain characteristics that are not always used. Two examples of this are \textit{cooling setpoint} in housing units with no cooling system, and \textit{clothes washer usage level} in housing units with no clothes washer. This doesn't impact the building energy models, this is merely a mechanism that allows for variability in probability distributions if the schedules are used for an upgrade. These characteristics, however, can lead to confusion because they're preserved in the metadata as being assigned even if they're not modeled. For further discussion see the the BuildStock Batch \href{https://buildstockbatch.readthedocs.io/en/v2023.10.0/project_defn.html#upgrade-scenarios}{Upgrade Scenario} documentation.

\section{Energy Consumption by Fuel and End Use}
The ResStock workflow models each housing unit sample in OpenStudio and EnergyPlus to produce energy consumption of each model at subhourly time steps and then processes the results into ResStock outputs. These outputs are produced by fuel type (e.g., electricity, natural gas) and end use (e.g., lighting, heating). Totals are calculated for each fuel and for all fuels combined. For electricity and all fuels combined, net totals are also calculated, which incorporate the impacts of on-site photovoltaics. The full list of energy consumption outputs from the ResStock workflow is available in Table \ref{table:results_output_fields}. Note that to date, ResStock has included only consumption of electricity, natural gas, propane, and fuel oil---excluding on-site consumption, wood, coal, or other fuels in its modeling, although the workflow is set up to include these additional fuels. Future releases will likely include wood. 

As an output, the energy consumption results are all preceded with an ``out.'' prefix, followed by either the fuel type (e.g., ``out.electricity.'') or ``total.'' if it is an aggregate of all fuel types, and then the end use, ``net.''  or ``total.'' if it is an aggregate of all end uses in that fuel type.
%%%% Bill calculations are really confusing and need to be better covered either here or OS-HPXML (or both). OS-HPXML documentation is lacking

\section{Cost Multipliers}
The ResStock workflow calculates and outputs certain values to support the calculation of costs of implementation of upgrades and upgrade packages. These are values that are available to scale measure implementation cost---for example, the total square feet of exterior window area in a housing unit model sample that can be multiplied by a user-provided window cost per square foot for a specific measure to get a per-housing-unit measure cost. They are calculated from the building energy models. ResStock currently provides 21 such values, as listed in Table \ref{table:cost_multipliers}. In published ResStock datasets, these cost multipliers are the fields that use the ``out.params'' prefix, for example ``out.params.window\_area\_ft\_2.'' The exception is that ``upgrade\_costs.floor\_area\_conditioned\_ft\_2'' has to-date been published as ``in.sqft.''

\section{Emissions}
%Standard convention of how we do this. Methodology. 
The ResStock workflow includes the capability of including emissions factors as supplemental inputs, which are then used to calculate the corresponding emissions outputs. These outputs are generated by end use and fuel type, as well as per-fuel totals. Total emissions impacts of a measure across fuels are calculated from ResStock results.

\subsection{Emissions From On-Site Combustion (Scope 1)}
The ResStock workflow currently accepts emissions factors for non-electric energy consumption as annual values only. Our typical approach is to use the values from Table 7.1.2(1) of PDS-01 of BSR/RESNET/ICCC 301 Addendum B, CO\textsubscript{2} Index (\cite{RESNET2022}), which account for both combustion and pre-combustion (e.g., methane leakage) impacts. These are 147.3 lb/MMBtu (228.5 kg/MWh) for natural gas, 177.8 lb/MMBtu (275.8 kg/MWh) for propane, and 195.9 lb/MMBtu (303.9 kg/MWh) for fuel oil. ResStock then outputs the associated carbon-equivalent emissions for every fuel and end-use combination. 

If multiple emissions scenarios are being run, ResStock will output values for each fuel for each end use for each scenario, even if that particular fuel's emissions factors do not differ between scenarios. This occurs frequently when we run multiple electricity emissions scenarios with different values for emissions factors related to electricity generation that all use the same emissions factors for on-site non-electric fuel consumption. The full list of emissions output fields from non-electric energy consumption is in Table \ref{table:emissions_output}. In published ResStock datasets, we convert the units on these results to kilograms of CO\textsubscript{2} equivalent emissions. These are the fields in public datasets that begin ``out.emissions.natural\_gas,'' ``out.emissions.propane,'' and ``out.emissions.fuel\_oil.''

\subsection{Emissions From Electricity Generation (Scope 2)}
The ResStock workflow currently accepts emissions factors for electricity consumption as either annual or hourly values. We have used several approaches in selecting electricity emissions factors for use. Our most commonly used approach is to include multiple scenarios, generally relying on data from NREL's Cambium database (\cite{Cambium2023}). When using Cambium data, we use multiple standard scenarios (potential futures of the electric grid) as a type of sensitivity. ResStock releases generally have three long-run marginal emissions scenarios with a computed a levelized factor over a 15 or 25 year lifetime with a 3\% discount rate, starting a few years in the future. We then use timeseries (hourly) data at the GEA geographic resolution. 

The full list of emissions output fields from electric energy consumption is in Table \ref{table:emissions_output}. In published ResStock datasets, we convert the units on these results to kilograms of CO\textsubscript{2} equivalent emissions. These are the fields in public datasets that begin ``out.emissions.electricity.''

\section{Utility Bills}
The ResStock workflow is able to accept a limited range of utility rate inputs and output the corresponding utility bills. The inputs available are fixed charges and volumetric rates for each modeled fuel (typically electricity, natural gas, propane, and fuel oil). These can vary by any one housing characteristic, such as State. Multiple scenarios may be specified. For the list of utility bill outputs, see Table \ref{table:cost_multipliers}.

Our most common approach within the ResStock workflow for utility rates for electricity and natural gas is to use a single scenario, using both a flat charge and a per-consumption charge. We typically use data downloaded from \href{https://openei.org/wiki/Utility_Rate_Database}{NREL's Utility Rate Database} to calculate the customer-weighted average fixed monthly electricity charge across all utilities in the database, which comes out to approximately \$10/customer/month or \$120/customer/year. For natural gas, we use the American Gas Association's 2015 value of \$11.25/customer/month for the fixed portion of the utility bill (generally referred to as the ``customer charge''). We additionally use EIA state-level information on revenue, sales, and number of customers to calculate the average per-consumption electricity and natural gas rate for each state with the fixed charges removed. The total electricity and natural gas bills for each housing unit model sample are then calculated by summing the flat charge and the product of the per-consumption charge and the total consumption. For example, this process may result in a flat charge of \$120/year and a per-consumption electricity rate of \$0.20/kWh---for a housing unit with a full year electricity consumption of 3000 kWh, the total electricity bill would be \$120 + (3,000 kWh * \$0.20/kWh) = \$720. If a housing unit has uses no natural gas for the year, the flat charge is not included as it is presumed not to have natural gas service. 

Our most common approach within the ResStock workflow for utility rates for propane and fuel oil is to use a single scenario using weekly volumetric rate data from the EIA, averaged over a year (either a calendar year or a winter). When state-level data are not available, we use data from the state's Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (PADD) region. When PADD region data are not available, we use U.S. national average values. We then calculate propane and fuel oil bills by multiplying the fuel consumption for each housing unit model by the volumetric rate for that fuel and state. An example of this is in ResStock dataset 2024.1 \citep{Present2024}.

In public ResStock datasets, these fields are prefixed with ``out.bills.''

We do not currently commonly model other on-site fuel use in ResStock, such as on-site use of wood or coal, or district steam, and we do not have a common approach for calculating associated bills.%What about district steam?

\end{longtable}

ResStock results can also be used as inputs to calculate utility bills using other rate structures, such as time-of-use electricity rates or tiered rates. However, these calculations are currently not included in the primary ResStock workflow or any published datasets.
% \section{PRIORITY C NEC Load Calculations}
\section{Energy Burden}
Energy burden is calculated as the ratio of two values from ResStock data. The first is the energy bill, which is calculated for each individual housing unit model in an analysis as described in the above section. The second is the representative household income, which is converted from income bin and other household characteristics described in Section \ref{resstock_input_energy_burden}. The energy burden is the energy bill total divided by the representative household income, typically expressed as a percentage. As the utility bill does not account for financial assistance such as LIHEAP, energy burden may be overestimated for low-income households who may qualify for those assistance. Additionally, the representative income is in 2019 USD, reflecting the vintage of PUMS used to derived the data. The dollar value of the utility bill is typically more recent and thus may not align with that of the income denominator.

When this field is available in public datasets, it begins with ``out.energy\_burden.''
\section{Electrical Panels}
For electrical panel, occupied capacity and breaker spaces are calculated and available as both a total aggregate and itemized by end use. In public ResStock datasets, these fields are prefixed with “out.electric_panel” and described in \ref{tab:panels}. 

For capacity, total occupied load (W) can be calculated using different methods and will be labeled accordingly. In the public datasets, both methods for existing dwellings per 2023 NEC are used: load-based (220.83) from the bottom-up and meter-based (220.87) using the simulated annual peak electricity. See section XX for details on the methods. The occupied capacity (A) is converted from occupied load (W) by dividing it by 240V, the voltage service of the panel, and then subtracted from the in.electrical_panel_service_rating (A) to get the headroom capacity (A). Users can use the headroom capacity to estimate the number of homes that may require an electrical intervention, such as panel or service upsizing, for a given electrification upgrade. If the headroom capacity value is negative, then the panel is said to be capacity-constrained, and an intervention may be required. If the headroom is positive, a capacity-related panel upgrade is not required. Headroom capacity is also calculated for the baseline and a negative value, while uncommon, can be interpreted as the home already being capacity-constrained prior to any upgrade. This is consistent with anecdotal observations that some homes do in fact trip their breakers often, an indication of a capacity shortfall. However, it's important to interpret any electrical panel outcomes as modeled estimates and that results with negative capacity headroom in the baseline have the same degree of uncertainty as those with positive capacity headroom.  

For breaker spaces, headroom count is labeled as an output metric but is actually an input characteristic probabilistically assigned based on the panel service rating and the number of major electrical loads of the home. Because the headroom count is predetermined in the baseline, it can never be negative, unlike capacity. Using the input headroom count and a bottom-up tabulation of electrical equipment in the home, the total rated space count is determined for the baseline. In the upgrade simulations, this total rated count remains the same for the home and the headroom count is recalculated according to the content of the upgrade package. See section XX for details. Users can estimate the number of homes that are space-constrained and requiring mitigation by looking at the negative values of the headroom count, similar to capacity.
