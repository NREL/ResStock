        Title:
        HVAC Autosizing Limits

        Description:
        For ducted HVAC system upgrades, adds the ability to (1) limit the autosized capacity to the maximum of the existing duct system's heating/cooling airflow rates, and (2) adjust the blower fan efficiency to maintain the duct system curve, using only a single option from the lookup.
